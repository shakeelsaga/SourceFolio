# SourceFolio

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sourcefolio.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/sourcefolio/)

SourceFolio is a CLI tool that automates research by fetching information from multiple sources like **Wikipedia**, **OpenLibrary**, and **NewsAPI** based on user-provided keywords. It provides a seamless experience for collecting and exporting data into clean, readable formats.

## Features

- **Interactive Session**: A guided, step-by-step process for users who prefer a prompted workflow.
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Gathers data from:
  - **Wikipedia**: Summary or full-page content.
  - **OpenLibrary**: Related books and authors.
  - **NewsAPI**: Recent news articles.
- **Smart API Key Handling**: Automatically prompts for and securely stores your NewsAPI key on the first run.
- **Data Preview**: Displays a summary of collected data directly in the terminal before export.
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Exports comprehensive reports to **PDF** (with clickable links) and **CSV**.
- **Rich Terminal UI**: Uses modern, interactive prompts and progress bars for a better user experience.

## 📦 Installation

SourceFolio is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI). You can install it directly using `pip`:

```bash
pip install sourcefolio
```

To upgrade to the latest version, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sourcefolio
```

## 🛠️ Configuration

SourceFolio requires a free API key from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) to fetch news articles.

The first time you run the application, it will automatically guide you through a one-time setup:

1.  You will be prompted to enter your NewsAPI key.
2.  The application will validate the key to ensure it's working.
3.  Your key will be securely saved in a configuration file in your home directory (`~/.sourcefolio/config.json`) for all future sessions.

On subsequent runs, the application will confirm your saved key and give you the option to continue using it, change it, or remove it.

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the tool directly from your terminal.

To start the guided, interactive session, simply run:

```bash
sourcefolio
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter keywords, choose the level of detail, and export your research report.

**Tip:** You can exit the application at any point by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting

### Windows: `'sourcefolio' is not recognized as an internal or external command...`

This error typically happens on Windows if your Python installer was not configured to "Add Python to PATH". This means the system doesn't know where to find the `sourcefolio` command.

Newer Python installers or distributions like Anaconda often handle this automatically, but the fix is simple:

1.  Press the **Windows Key**, type **`env`**, and select **"Edit the system environment variables"**.
2.  Click the **"Environment Variables..."** button.
3.  In the top "User variables" box, select the **`Path`** variable and click **"Edit..."**.
4.  Click **"New"** and paste in the path to your Python `Scripts` folder.
      * *You can find this path by running `py -m site --user-site` in your command prompt and replacing `site-packages` with `Scripts`.*
      * *It will look something like this: `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\Python\PythonXX\Scripts`*
5.  Click "OK" on all windows to save.
6.  **Completely close and re-open your terminal.** The `sourcefolio` command will now work.

## Project Roadmap

This is the first public version of SourceFolio. I am planning on continuing to include more features in the future. Some of the planned enhancements include:

  - **More Data Sources:** Integration with additional data sources such as academic journals and social media.
  - **Selective Data Output:** Users will be able to choose which data sources to include in the final output.
  - **Command-Line Flags:** The ability to use the tool directly from the command line with flags, bypassing the interactive mode.
