## Note

Some queries may work in one API but fail in others (for example, `c++` may succeed in one but not another). We have recently added fixes to sanitize input and handle special characters properly to prevent crashes and improve consistency across different APIs. If you encounter test cases or discrepancies not listed here, feel free to fork this repository and update the test_log. Youâ€™re also welcome to open a pull request so I can review and merge your updates.
